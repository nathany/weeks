## Run

Build and run:

```console
go run weeks.go
```

Build then run:

```console
go build
./weeks
```

## Tests

Run the tests and include % test coverage:

```console
go test -cover 
```

### Time zone abbreviations

Time zone abbreviations such as `CST` are ambiguous.[^1] It's no trouble to display them, but parsing them doesn't work quite right. Oddly, the Go standard library makes an attempt at it instead of rejecting layouts containing MST.

```go
badTime, err := time.Parse("2006-01-02 3:04 PM (MST)", "1977-04-05 11:58 AM (PST)")
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}
fmt.Println("bad", badTime)

location, err := time.LoadLocation("America/Vancouver")
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}
goodTime, err := time.ParseInLocation("2006-01-02 3:04 PM", "1977-04-05 11:58 AM", location)
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}
fmt.Println("good", goodTime)
```

This code[^2] produces the following result :

```
bad 1977-04-05 11:58:00 +0000 PST
good 1977-04-05 11:58:00 -0800 PST
```

Too bad the time zone offset is completely wrong! You can imagine how displaying the time with a format string would hide the offset and make it seem like everything was working (yes, that happened). Except the duration calculations were off.

Well, at least it's well documented:

> "If the zone abbreviation is unknown, Parse records... the given zone abbreviation and a zero offset."[^3]

When I first implemented this, I didn't read the documentation carefully enough. After tracking down the bug, I landed on a GitHub Issue and switched to `time.ParseInLocation`.

> "It is not a goal that time.Time.Format and time.Parse be exact reverses of each other."[^4]
